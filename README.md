### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas and currently working with metagenomics at VIB-KU Leuven. 

I also have experience with RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Genome assembly and other Bioinformatics areas. You can check my list of publications at https://lucas-maciel.github.io/

My repos so far are private as they are related to my work at companies, but in the future I intend to make some of them public.
